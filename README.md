# IN1910
The following file consists of programming projects done in this course with stiasos. The programming languages were mainly Python and C++.

Project #1: The first project was about implementing mathematical formulas and physics formulas in Python to compute the properties of one pendulum and two pendulums joint together. Moreover, the computations were also used to compute the movement and the resistance of the pendulum gong back and forth and using plots to illustrate the movements of one pendulum and two joint pendulums.

Project #2: The second project consists of using C++ to construct a list and its properties. We had to construct an arraylist (normal type of list used in Python) and a linked list and constructing the properties like adding, removing, replacing and changing the position of an element to a list.

Project #3: The third projects uses Python again to generate fractals.
